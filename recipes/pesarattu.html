    <h1>Pesarattu</h1>
    <img src="../images/pesarattu.jpg" alt="pesarattu-image">
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>This is a Andhra specialty. Pesarattu is a dosa made with Pesara Pappu (moong dal).</p>
    <p>You use the moong dal with skin on and this is what gives this dosa the classic green color. Of course this dosa is high in protein and fiber.</p>
    <p>Serve it with upma rolled inside and it becomes an 'MLA pesarattu'.</p>
    <p>This is a heavy lentil batter and does not keep very well. Use up the batter within 2 days.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups skin-on, whole green lentils (sabut moong dal)</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>5 green chile peppers</li>
        <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons chopped onion (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the lentils and rice into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 4 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Blend the lentils, rice, green chile peppers, and ginger together into a smooth paste using a blender or food processor. Stir the cumin seed and salt into the paste.</li>
        <li>Prepare a flat griddle (tawa) or large, flat-bottomed skillet and place over medium-low heat. Ladle the lentil batter onto the middle of the heated surface and spread into a thin circle using the back of the ladle. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of onions and press the onions onto the pesarattu using your ladle or spatula. Cook for a few minutes and flip over to the other side. Cook a few more minutes, transfer to a plate and serve immediately. Dosas are best eaten hot and crispy right off the tawa.</li>
