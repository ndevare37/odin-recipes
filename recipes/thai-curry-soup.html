    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>This delicious Thai-style soup has coconut milk, shrimp, mushrooms, and spinach. Chicken may be substituted for the shrimp; either way, I love this soup anytime!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces rice noodles (pad thai noodles)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons minced lemon grass</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons red curry paste</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (13.5 ounce) can reduced-fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>½ cup peeled and deveined medium shrimp</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rice noodles and cook until al dente, about 3 minutes. Drain and rinse well with cold water to stop the cooking; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic, lemon grass, and ginger; cook and stir until aromatic, 30 to 60 seconds. Add the curry paste, and cook 30 seconds more. Pour in about 1/2 cup of the chicken broth, and stir until the curry paste has dissolved, then pour in the remaining chicken stock along with the soy sauce and sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in coconut milk, shrimp, mushrooms, spinach, lime juice, and cilantro. Increase heat to medium-high, and simmer until the shrimp turn pink and are no longer translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, place some rice noodles into each serving bowl and ladle soup on top of them. Garnish each bowl with a sprinkle of sliced green onion.</li>
    </ol>
